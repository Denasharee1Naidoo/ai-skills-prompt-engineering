  ai_response: "[]]"Subject: Update on WhatsApp Integration Project Timeline

Dear Stakeholders,

I hope this message finds you well.

I’m writing to inform you that the WhatsApp integration project will experience a delay of approximately two weeks. We sincerely apologize for this shift in timeline and understand the importance of timely delivery for all involved.

The delay is primarily due to unforeseen technical challenges encountered during the integration of third-party APIs. Our development team identified compatibility issues that require additional testing and refinement to ensure a stable and secure implementation. Addressing these now will help us avoid larger disruptions later in the project lifecycle.

Revised Timeline:

Original Go-Live: [Insert Original Date]
New Target Go-Live: [Insert New Date, +2 weeks]
Next Steps:

The technical team is actively resolving the integration issues and will complete regression testing by [Insert Date].
We will provide a detailed progress update in our next stakeholder sync.
A revised project plan will be shared by [Insert Date].
We remain committed to delivering a high-quality solution and appreciate your continued support and understanding. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to discuss the revised timeline in more detail.

Warm regards,
Denasharee Naidoo
Senior Business Analyst
